          I have a passion for creating impactful technology that addresses real-world challenges. 
          My journey in software development began with my completion of a Software Engineering program at Moringa School, where I met great instructors, colleagues and worked with diverse teams as a student and students' representative. 
          The experience impressed on me the value of people and interpersonal relationships. 
          I love engaging in complex problems, focus on building adaptable and client-oriented applications.
          Besides programming, I also love watching movie series, documentaries, time with friends and family, and road trips.
